      My name is Manuel Alejandro, but my friends call me Jano. a former
      professional wrestler who had the opportunity to perform on international
      stages like WWE ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ and Pro Wrestling NOAH ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ.
    </p>

    <p>
      My time in the ring taught me the power of storytelling, discipline, and
      visual impactâ€”lessons I now apply to the creative and digital world.
    </p>

    <p>
      Beyond wrestling, Iâ€™m a passionate creative focused on UI/UX design and
      web development, <strong
        >crafting digital products that blend platforms to tell stories, inspire
        action, and drive meaningful change.</strong
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      Driven by a deep curiosity for solving problems through visual design, I
      consider myself a lifelong learner â€” constantly building on my design
      expertise and expanding my knowledge in software development through
      ongoing courses and professional growth.
